# Dynamic Programming

## Bottom-up / Tabulation
   - Straightfoward alogorithm
   - Need to understand the subproblems clearly, which is usually complicated
   * In other words, we solve each subproblem only once. When we see it, we have already solve all of its prerequisite subproblems. *
## Top-down / Memorization
   - Utilizing recursive calls
   - Time comsuming
   * It remembers the results that have been previously calculated *

## Key terms
